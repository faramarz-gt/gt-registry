# 🎭 GTreasury Design System Registry
*Where financial artistry meets digital craftsmanship*

---

## 🌅 *In the Beginning...*

There was data, scattered like autumn leaves across spreadsheets and dashboards. There were colors without harmony, components without soul, and teams building in isolation. Then came the Registry—a sanctuary where GTreasury's design language finds its voice, where every pixel tells a story of financial precision wrapped in digital beauty.

This is not merely a component library. This is a living, breathing ecosystem where **GTreasury's visual DNA** flows through every chart, every button, every gentle gradient that whispers of corporate excellence.

## 🔐 *The Sacred Gateway*

*Behind these digital walls lies treasure—but only for the chosen.*

Our Registry breathes with **magic link authentication**, a seamless dance between **Redis-powered tokens** and **Zapier's gentle whispers** that carry invitations through the digital ether. Only those bearing `@gtreasury.com` in their name may enter this sanctum of design.

When you speak your email to our gateway:
- A **SHA-256 encrypted token** births itself in Redis clouds ☁️
- **Zapier's webhook** carries your golden key through internet highways 📧
- **24 hours** you have to claim your destiny, then the token dissolves like morning mist 🌅
- **One time only**—each key opens but once, then crumbles to digital dust ✨

## 🎨 *The Palette of Possibilities*

### **Night Blue** `#012030` 
*Deep as midnight oceans, steady as corporate foundations*

### **Sea Blue** `#115D7E`
*Where waves meet wisdom, where trust finds its hue*

### **Peppermint Green** `#45C4B0`
*Fresh as morning dew on spreadsheet success*

### **GSmart Gradient** `#E33277 → #F4C548`
*A sunrise captured in code, flowing from passion to gold*
